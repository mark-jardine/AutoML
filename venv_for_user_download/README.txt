This folder contains both .sh and .bat files.

If you are on a windows machine you will need to run the .bat files.

If you are on a linux machine you will need to run the .sh files.

SETUP
To setup the virtual environment you will need to run the setup script (either .bat or .sh) called setup_RUN_ME.

This script will create the directories and install the dependencies.

INFORMATION
My own small dataset is included in the datasets folder called african_animals which contains images of Lions, Zebras and Hyenas all stored in YOLO format.
The train and detect commands are written for you in .bat or .sh files and you can edit them to input different parameters or filepaths if you create your own dataset.
Visit https://mark-jardine.github.io/ for more information on to create a dataset as well as a description of the overall project and its goals.
