This repo contains notebooks involving traing custom datasets on YOLOv5 using fast.ai.
My goal is to create a Automated ML environment that allows non-technical users to train and deploy ML models using custom datasets.


Installation: 
Download venv_for_user_download and run the setup script inside (.sh or .bat depending on your OS).
See README in download for more information.

Info: 
My own small dataset is included in the datasets folder called african_animals which contains images of Lions, Zebras and Hyenas all stored in YOLO format.
The train and detect commands are written for you in .bat or .sh files and you can edit them to input different parameters or filepaths if you create your own dataset.
Visit https://mark-jardine.github.io/ for more information on to create a dataset as well as a description of the overall project and its goals.
